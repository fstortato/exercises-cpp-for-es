## Proposed exercise

* Develop a program that reads an character and two integer numbers. If the character is "a", add the numbers. If it is "s", subtract them. If it is "m", perform the product. If it is "d", perform the division. Show the result on the screen. Use a switch stucture.
* Repeat the previous program, but using functions with return for each operation.
* Adapt the previous program, overloading the functions. Use the same functions, but with floating point parameters and return.
